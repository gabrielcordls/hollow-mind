# A Hollow Knight Memory Game developed at Manual do Dev. ðŸŽ®

### The project was recreated in the Youtube Channel of Manual do Dev using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. originally a memory game created with a rick and morty theme.

- HTML -- CSS -- JavaScript -- Git and Github

I decided to recreate the project incrementing it with my style and with a different theme from the acclaimed metroidvania game [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com), 
a masterpiece of the gaming world.
